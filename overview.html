<html><body>This document is the API specification for ZetaGrid, version 1.9.3.<p>The goal of ZetaGrid is to use the free capacity of voluntarily participating cross-platform computers (even game consoles or mainframes)that can use slow communications. One of the most important factors for the acceptance of such a computational grid system is to ensure privacyand control for the participating clients. This platform schedules a configured large number of loosely-coupled, independent work units of differentstatic sizes. Every computer with free capacity can request those work units in size or number corresponding to a user-defined capacity.The participator may complete the work unit offline or online. The completed work units are then delivered back to the server, where the results are verified.To make verification of results possible, the work units contain overlapping information and can be redistributed or recomputed.Successful and regular participators are rewarded with trust levels, so that they will be treated preferentially; that is, their results do not have to bechecked rigorously and they can obtain more work units.<p>The interactions, performance, availability, and scalability of this technology are proven in multiple administrative domains involving more than 10,000computers in a heterogeneous, dynamic environment. The first project of ZetaGrid was a mathematical one: the verification of the zeros of the zeta function(that's where the name "ZetaGrid" comes from). ZetaGrid was initially developed and tested in the IBM Boeblingen Lab.Further successful projects include image deconvolution in life science and a boolean satisfaction (SAT) solver in computer science.<p>This technology provides simple J2EE interfaces to developers for adapting applications in multi-computer grids so that they distribute applications securelyand reliably. The operational model of the platform is a three-tier architecture: The Web server, the application server, and the database are placed in threedifferent zones. Zones are a representation of an area for which a common set of nonfunctional requirements has been defined, such as firewalls.The rich client is implemented in Java and communicates only with the Web server of the middle tier via stateless sessions using HTTP. In this concept,a client connects to the server in order to synchronize the client version, to request work units, and to deliver completed work units.The server never connects to a client to get any data. All interaction is initiated and defined by the participating user, since the user is the only personwho can judge the free capacity of his resources. He can choose to run the client as a low-priority background process, or in screensaver mode.ZetaGrid is optimized for all kinds and speeds of connections, such as modem, LAN, and WAN.<p>ZetaGrid provides a secure Java kernel that secures its communications and activities by restricted layer access with digital signatures andkey establishment protocols. Furthermore, it makes every source (except private keys) open for the community. The client is entirely written in Java so thatJava2 Security concepts (for example, the Java Sandbox) can be enabled to ensure that an untrusted -- and possibly malicious -- application cannot gain accessto system resources.</body></html>
