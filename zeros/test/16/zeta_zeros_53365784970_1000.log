We did not yield any zeros between 16220609807.34 and 16220609807.92 and the new rule has not found additional zeros in previous Gram block.
Therefore, the new rule will be activated for the next Gram block.
Number of sign changes should be 2, but we found only 0.
This happened between 53365784978 and 53365784980.
