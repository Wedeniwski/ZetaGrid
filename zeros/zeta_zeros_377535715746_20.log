This run (LASTN=377535715746, NRANGE=20, MDIMENS=129425, VERSION=0141) was started at Sat Jul 03 08:29:38 2004
Initial Gram point G(377535715745)=105233436579.216
Bad start with LASTN=377535715746, Z(105233436579.216)=0 this starting value is too small.
LASTN is decreased by 1 due to this 'unclear' value of Z(t).

We did not yield any zeros between 105233436579.483 and 105233436580.017 and the new rule has not found additional zeros in previous Gram block.
Therefore, the new rule will be activated for the next Gram block.
Number of sign changes should be 2, but we found only 0.
This happened between 377535715746 and 377535715748.
