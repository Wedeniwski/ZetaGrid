# Size of the work units (estimates are made on Pentium IV 2 GHz, April 2003)
# Please note: After a time frame of about 7 days all incomplete work units
#              will be redistributed.
# t: tiny work unit ~  2 hours
# s: small work unit ~  4 hours
# m: medium work unit ~ 6 hours  (recommended)
# l: large work unit ~  8 hours
# h: huge work unit ~  12 hours
# Remark: The performance index will decrease about 0.3% per day because the
#         complexity to separate the zeros is growing continuously.
#         Therefore, the perfomance index will be 10% lower in about 30 days.

# Number of work units
# The general limit of work units provided by the server is 5 for beginners,

# and 25 for users who calculated more than 100 million zeros.
# Every work unit expires after 7 days.

# The client will be terminated after calculating a number of work units.

# units and never stops.

# Schedules the timeframes when the client can activate the computation
# Format: {<Day of Week><start hour>:<start minute>-<stop hour>:<stop minute>}*
# <Day of Week>: the name of the day, i.e. (Mo, Tu, We, Th, Fr, Sa, Su)
# <start hour>: controls what hour the computation will start, and is specified
#               in the 24 hour clock, values must be between 0 and 23
#               (0 is midnight)
# <start minute>: controls what minute of the hour the computation will start,
#                 value must be between 0 and 59
# <stop hour>: controls what hour the computation will start, and is specified
#              in the 24 hour clock, values must be between 0 and 23
#              (0 is midnight)
# <stop minute>: controls what minute of the hour the computation will stop,
#                value must be between 0 and 59
